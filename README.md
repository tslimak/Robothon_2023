## Environment & System Configuration
The project is developed and tested with the following configuration:
* Ubuntu 20.04
* Kernel: 5.9.1-rt20
* gcc/g++ 9.4.0
* cmake 3.16.3
* C++20

## Build
1. Install *ROS Noetic* as described [here](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu).
1. Make sure you have the most up to date packages:
```bash
rosdep update
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```
1. Install all the packages as listed in the `.gitlab-ci.yml`, e.g. `sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-libfranka` etc.
1. Clone the project with all its submodules: `git clone --recursive https://gitlab.lrz.de/AM/robothon2023.git`
1. Configure the *catkin* workspace and build the project:
```bash
cd robothon2023/catkin_ws
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
rosdep install -y --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro ${ROS_DISTRO}
catkin config --extend /opt/ros/${ROS_DISTRO} --cmake-args -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
catkin build
```

## Run the Taskboard
Open four terminals and navigate to the `catkin_ws` folder in each. Run:
  1. `roslaunch task_planner run_application.launch`
  1. `roslaunch realsense2_camera rs_camera.launch align_depth:=true filters:=pointcloud ordered_pc:=true`
  1. `./src/planar_pose/src/object_detection.py`
  1. `./src/planar_pose/src/planar_pose_estimation.py`

## Calibration
We use the approach described [here](https://ros-planning.github.io/moveit_tutorials/doc/hand_eye_calibration/hand_eye_calibration_tutorial.html) to calibrate the transformation between the `camera_color_optical_frame` of the *Intel RealSense D415* and the `panda_link8` frame of our *Franka Emika* robot.
